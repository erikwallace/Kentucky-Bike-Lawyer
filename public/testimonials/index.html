            <p>Chris and Steve are top-notch. I contacted them for advice when my insurance company reached out to me to determine who was at fault for a cycling accident that I had. Chris and Steve are experts in handling these types of issues. They guided me through the whole process, they always listened and requested my feedback. They were able to explain complex legal issues into language that I could understand, and they always kept my satisfaction as top priority. They were a pleasure to work with.</p>

            <p>I was an avid cyclist, and had known Chris very casually from a few group rides. I was fortunate to get to know him
                much better after I was hit by an at-fault SUV in May 2022. Chris worked in collaboration with Steve Magas to sort out
                the intricacies of my case and explain them in a manner that was easy to understand. Step by step through the process, I
                was kept abreast of any developments and negotiations, and Chris was always just a phone call away for any questions or
                just to listen to me. Chris has a very compassionate manner, and did a great service to me in managing my expectations
                and ultimately delivering results in my personal injury claim.</p>

            <p>I contacted Chris Carville following a citation I received while riding my bike. The details of the citation made
                little sense in the context of the conditions at the time. I was worried that points would be assessed to my
                driver&apos;s license, despite my not operating a motor vehicle at the time, as the ticket was to be processed by a
                Mayor&apos;s Court, which are notorious for their rapid and coercive processing of tickets. Chris was professional from
                the start and provided me with a clear and realistic expectation of what to expect going forward. Chris&apos;s presence
                in negotiation with municipal officials put me at ease in what would otherwise be an imposing situation and he ensured
                that the citation did not impact my driving record. Should I require legal representation in the future I will consult
                Carville Legal Counsel.</p>

            <p>Last summer I was forced off the road by a car carrier while I was riding my bike. The semi overcame me just as I was
                entering into a one lane right hand turn. His back wheels narrowly missed crushing me and I was thrown over the
                handlebars, taking the brunt of the fall on my mouth and chin. The driver proceeded to travel down the road. I landed in
                the gutter not believing that I was still alive. I was in terrible pain but I was choking on my own blood and I forced
                myself to stand and breathe. The driver had stopped and walked back towards me as I spit mouthfuls of blood into the
                grass and on the pavement. He said he would get me a paper towel from his truck- and then he drove off.</p>
            <p>Without a witness to my accident, it seemed that this would be just one more tough luck story. But my boyfriend was
                adamant that we contact Chris Carville. Chris was fantastic from the moment we first talked. He was knowledgeable about
                the rights of cyclists and committed to helping me with my case. He worked with the police to obtain evidence and track
                down the driver and his employer. Their insurance company tried to brush us off, but Chris persevered and he set things
                straight.</p>
            <p>Ten months later we received a check from the trucking company&apos;s insurer. I no longer look like the walking
                dead, my broken thumb has healed and I still have all my teeth. All the bruises have faded. I have to thank Chris,
                because even though the law was on my side, there would have been no justice without his hard work. Thank you, Chris- we
                are all sharing the road!</p>

            <p>Going through a set of injuries, knowing how to get through the steps correctly and easily is not an easy set of
                tasks. Having someone to guide and help me through it was very helpful. Also, having someone who knows very well how to
                navigate the waters of insurance and recovery and being empathetic and easy to reach by phone and email is also very
                helpful and Chris did all of these. He even answered my call while he was outside riding his bicycle. Not many attorneys
                will go to the trouble of taking care of their client like he does. The process was made easier and I&apos;m thankful to

            <p>Being a cyclist I recalled hearing Steve Magas on the radio on several occasions. Steve was interviewed relating to
                cycling laws and cyclist issues. After listening to Steve I decided if I ever had an issue I would want a lawyer with a
                knowledge in my hobby to represent me.</p>
            <p>After my accident I told my wife to contact Steve for help. The decision was a good one. Steve brought in Chris
                Carville to assist in my case.</p>

                Chris and Steve met with my wife and I to discuss the case and completely explained the process.</p>

            <p>I&apos;m an avid cyclist and was struck by a car while riding. After several stressful months of handling the

                him, he kindly reviewed the police report and gave me a free consultation over the phone. Chris being a cyclist himself,
                was able to empathize and provide a wealth of information regarding my situation. My wife and I decided to move forward
                with having Chris represent us. From that moment on, we couldn&apos;t have been more thankful for the services Chris
